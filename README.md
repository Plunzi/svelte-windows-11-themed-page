### What is this?

This is a windows 11 themed page built with svelte [Svelte](http://svelte.dev/). I was also using many assets from [fluent-svelte](https://fluent-svelte.vercel.app/) component UI library that emulates the look and feel of [Microsoft's Windows UI Controls](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/)..

To run project, type:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
